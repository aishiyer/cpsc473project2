What is left to do:
1. PICTURES LIBRARY (pictures.hbs) Create a pictures library so you can see all the pictures you have uploaded (that means every time someone uploads a picture, it needs to show up on this.

2. PICTURES LIBRARY (pictures.hbs) Create a form where the user can enter in the title, description and the image upload button (to allow searching in your local computer for images). Once the user clicks SAVE, they click on the button that says VIEW IMAGE and it should redirect them back to step 1 where they can see all the images they have uploaded.

3. MESSAGES (messages.hbs) Create a messaging system where two users can communicate with each other. In order to do this, we need login authentication. OR we can do a mail system which also requires login authentication.
